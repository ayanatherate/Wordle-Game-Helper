# Wordle-Game-Helper
A Python program that would give you a headstart into playing Wordle. It won't guess THE correct word for you (because if it does, then well, the game would be no fun!) but it CAN help you guess the correct word. You have to feed it with information accordingly, it would assist you. Rest everything is left to your decision making and wisdom!

run 'wordle_game()' on a new jupyter notebook cell to start.
