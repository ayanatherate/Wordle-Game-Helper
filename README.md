# Wordle-Game-Helper
A simple program written in Python that would give you a headstart into playing Wordle. It won't guess THE correct word for you (because if it does, then well, the game would be no fun!) but it CAN help you guess the correct word. You have to feed it with information accordingly, it would assist you. Rest everything is left to your decision making and wisdom!

Edit: This is nowhere near perfect. At best, this is just a hobby project I built just for my own fun. So, bear with me please! Also, if anyone wants to assist me in building a front-end shell around it, please ping up!
